This is my tribute page for the Free Code Camp Portfolio project:

requirements for the challenge:

        ·I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

        ·I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

        ·I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

        ·I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

        ·Don't worry if you don't have anything to showcase on your portfolio yet - you will build several apps on the next few CodePen challenges, and can come back and update your portfolio later.

        ·Do NOT use a pre-made template or copy the code from the FCC example.
